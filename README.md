# scoti: Simulations for Characterising Optimal moniToring Implementations to inform the BEAM monitoring advice framework

the goal is to develop a simulation platofrm to help appraise monitoring designs that can yield adequate Bycatch rate estimates given fishing characteristics of a fleet and features of a species influencing bycatch probability.


here you will find the public-facing functions and code for SCOTI. This is a collaborative simulation project, feel free to join! 
below is a diagram of the current main functions (in blue) and I/O
